Title: Policy Seminars

Description: In policy seminars students work in groups first
formulating the general problem, then engaging in individual research on
subtopics, and finally presenting their inferences for discussion and
debate and producing a collective policy report.

Prerequisites: Enrollment is limited to WWS concentrators and
certificate students. The course is required for concentrators, for whom
it is considered Junior Independent Work.  Junior concentrators are
automatically signed up for the policy seminar as Junior Independent
Work, not as WWS 402.  WWS juniors who are certificate students must
enroll.  Seniors serving as commissioners and graduate students serving
as consultants may enroll with permission of the instructor.
