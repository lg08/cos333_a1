Title: Advanced C%Science Programming Techniques

Description: This is a course about the practice of programming.
Programming is more than just writing code.  Programmers must also
assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test,
improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves &
others. At the same time, they must be concerned with compatibility,
robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications.  Students
will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their
own code and in group projects.

Prerequisites: COS 217 and COS 226.

Professor: Brian W. Kernighan
