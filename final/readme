Yusuf Kocaman, Lucas Gen, Assignment 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yusuf:
I helped with setting up the argparser and read the
documentation in order to understand the functions parameters
and how to use it. I also helped a bit with string formating to print and
the making the prepared statements. I also helped write an automated testing program
Finally I was able to prevent wildcards from being injected into the prepared statement
by adding an escape character into the argument string with 'str.replace()'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lucas:
I helped with coming up with ways to grab information from the database and creating
the strings to do just that. For example, I helped come up with our method of grabbing
all of the correct information from the database for regdetails.py, by grabbing all the
data with a one-to-one relationship first, and then making subsequent queries to pick
up the data where there could be a many-to-one relationship. I also helped read the
documentation for the textwrapping and helped format everything correctly. I also
helped do a lot of the testing, including making the coverage report. Basically,
we worked on everything together though.

Assessment:
Yusuf:
I thought that this assignment was very helpful in understanding basic sql and getting
more used to python. Though we got stuck at some points, I generally enjoyed the assignment.
Lucas:
I also enjoyed this assignment and I liked getting some experience with sql
statements. I've used sqlite databases before, but never by issuing sql statements like
this assignment and I foud it helpful.
