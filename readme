Yusuf Kocaman, Lucas Gen, Assignment 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yusuf:
I helped with setting up the argparser and read the
documentation in order to understand the functions parameters 
and how to use it. I also helped a bit with string formating to print and 
the making the prepared statements. I also helped write an automated testing program
Finally I was able to prevent wildcards from being injected into the prepared statement 
by adding an escape character into the argument string with 'str.replace()'.
